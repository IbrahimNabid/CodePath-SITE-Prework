## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
1. https://www.w3schools.com/colors/default.asp - I used this site to find different colors I can use for the website and eventually learned about gradient color from here as well.
2. https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp - I used this site to find and learn about different fonts that I can use.
3. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_fonts.htm - I also used this site to learn more about font size and how I can alter it to my liking.
4. https://html.form.guide/snippets/css-button-rounded-corners/ - I also used this site to learn more about how I can round the buttons because I was curious and wanted to learn more beyond just the description given in the prework instructions. I ended up following this website and making my buttons into circles.
